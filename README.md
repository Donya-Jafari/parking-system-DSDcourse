# Parking Management System

A Verilog-based project that manages the parking spaces in a parking lot, distinguishing between university and non-university cars.

## Tools

## Implementation Details

This project utilizes Verilog to create a parking management system. The system monitors the number of parked and vacated cars, maintaining separate counts for university-affiliated and non-university vehicles. Additionally, the system enforces maximum capacity limits for parking spaces. Initial capacities are statically determined, while capacities for non-university vehicles vary dynamically based on time.
